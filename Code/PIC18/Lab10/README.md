# Lab 10
[Lab 10](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MporN-gmmc0)
- Note: Youtube uploaded it as a short, sorry about that
## Notes
- This lab was fairly straight forward in terms of thinking compared to 
lab 9
- It might help with the fact that I understand more over about C header 
files, since I tend to see that alot in my GHB stuff
