## Notes
- One of the things I ran into, which contributed to making this code more 
difficult, was how to get from the start to finish, i.e. the 0-1023 range 
to something more robust that can be used via BCD. For some reason, I kept 
wanted to convert it to binary, when my orginal code worked fine, but it 
was just outputing it to hex. So, I took the values, did the math, and 
converted to decimal.
