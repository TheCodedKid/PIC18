## Notes
- One of the main issues I had with this project was the idea of the 
Timer. I was a bit confused as to how exactly the interation coming off 
the logic worked.
- The stop interrupt itself seemed a bit odd at first, but after moving 
around the configuration bits at the beginning of the program, everything 
seemed to play more nicely.
- A couple of the ports needed to be changed as I had some issues with 
Port E for the signal pins, seems like Port A and D are my best friends 
so.
- Thank you so much for everything, professor. I'll come by your office to 
formally meet you when Fall comes around.
