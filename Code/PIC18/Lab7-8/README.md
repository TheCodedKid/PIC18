# Lab 7 and 8
[Lab 7 and 8 Youtube Link](https://youtu.be/E4HyrsTHAHc)

## Notes
- This is a combination git repo of both lab 7 and 8, since I placed them 
in the same project folder
- The circuit building itself was very straight forward
- I need to spend some more time with the interrupt mode, as this seems to 
comflict with a few characterisitcs found in the other modes that are 
multiplexed within similair ports.

- No schematic this week as I followed the provided one exactly
