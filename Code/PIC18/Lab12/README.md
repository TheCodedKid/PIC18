# Lab 12
[Lab 12](https://youtu.be/xu48onNCqkU)
## Notes
- I was able to get the lab to work, I just needed the new MOSFET to 
handle the amount of current moving to the fan
- With that being said, I didn't have a bunch of issue apart from the 
common ground (heh, and alot of my friends are mocking me about it because 
I am the one preaching about ground pours on our PCBs)
