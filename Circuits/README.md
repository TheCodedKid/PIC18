## **PIC18 Breakout Board**
This section is a work in progress. More will be added here as it is finalized.  
**The circuit is not complete, DO NOT ATTEMPT to build**  

## **Seven Segment Display Board**
*Tired of building large circuits on breadboards only to find that the 7447 anode display is not working right?*  
This circuit is for you, a complete solution to your truble when properly testing and diagnosing any issues you may have with displays.
Built on using easy to find components, this simple but useful plug and play should do the trick.
